 # *Challenges*
 1. This is the first application I have built that used Firebase's Real Time Database. I needed to figure out how to upload the UFO data in my database and get all the data from Firebase as needed. The following code snippet is how I fetched all the data needed. Note I placed this in the useEffect hook to fetch the data upon rendering.
